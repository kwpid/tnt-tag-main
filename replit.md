# Roblox Game Scripts Project

## Overview
This project contains Lua scripts for a Roblox game with two main components:
- **Actual_Game**: Main PVP game scripts
- **Lobby_Game**: Lobby area scripts

## Project Type
This is a Roblox game development project. The scripts are intended to run within the Roblox game engine, not as a standalone application.

## Structure

```

## Language & Environment
- **Language**: Lua 5.2
- **Platform**: Roblox Studio
