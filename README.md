This repository contains Lua scripts for a Roblox game project.

## Project Structure

  - `File.lua` - Lobby script

## About This Project

This is a Roblox game development project. The scripts here are meant to be used within Roblox Studio, not as a standalone application.

### What is Roblox?

Roblox is a game platform where developers create games using Lua scripting. The scripts in this repository would normally be imported into Roblox Studio and deployed to the Roblox platform.

### ServerScriptService

`ServerScriptService` is a Roblox service that contains scripts that run on the server side of your game. These scripts handle game logic, player data, and other server-side operations.

## Usage

To use these scripts:

1. Open Roblox Studio
2. Create or open your game project
3. Import these scripts into the appropriate service containers
4. Test and deploy your game through Roblox Studio

## Development

Since these are Roblox-specific Lua scripts, they require the Roblox environment to run. You can:

- Edit the scripts directly in this Replit environment
- Use the Lua language server for syntax checking
- Copy the scripts to Roblox Studio for testing and deployment

## Note

This is source code for a Roblox game and does not run as a standalone web application. The scripts require the Roblox game engine to execute properly.
