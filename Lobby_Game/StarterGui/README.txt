StarterGui Setup Instructions
=============================

Place the following script in StarterGui:
- CreateQueueGUI.lua

This script will automatically create the Queue GUI when a player joins the game.

The GUI includes:
- Queue button at the bottom of the screen
- Main menu with Casual and Ranked options
- Close button
- Professional animations and effects

The UI is controlled by QueueUIController.lua which should be in StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts.
